Stage
=====

Stage simulates a population of mobile robots, sensors and objects in
a two-dimensional bitmapped environment. Stage is designed to support
research into multi-agent autonomous systems, so it provides fairly
simple, computationally cheap models of lots of devices rather than
attempting to emulate any device with great fidelity

Stage is part of the Player Project, and is maintained by Richard
Vaughan (vaughan@sfu.ca).
