* Contributors: Dmitry Rozhkov, Kentaro Wada

1.9.8 (2016-11-15)
------------------
* Fix bond handling during nodelet unloading (`#51 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/51>`_)
  * add test whether bond breaking on unload works (tests `#50 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/50>`_)
  * disable callback for broken bond when we are breaking it
  This avoids the nodelet::LoaderROS::unload() method to be called
  twice for the same nodelet, causing an error output.
  * use AsyncSpinner for nodelet load in order for the shutdown procedure to work
  During shutdown, the bonds still need to communicate their status in order
  for the nodelet to properly/cleanly/quickly unload. This requires the node
  to spin.
  * add test whether LoaderROS::unload() is called twice (tests `#50 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/50>`_)
* Contributors: Daniel Seifert

1.7.1 (2012-10-02)
------------------
* adding nodelet_core metapackage and reving to 1.7.1

1.7.0 (2012-10-01)
------------------
* fix dependencies
* make it compile locally
* first pass at catkinizing the stack
* updated to latest pluginlib
* updated usage of pluginlib according to updated REP 121
* use updated pluginlib to auto-unload libraries when unloading nodelets
* fixed issue `#5144 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/5144>`_ on OS X lion
* Commentary on who owns what among Loader, Nodelet, CallbackQueue and CallbackQueueManager.
* Moved most of Loader's member variables into an opaque PIMPL struct so we can change things without breaking ABI.
* All bond code moved to LoaderROS. Loader no longer needs to know about bond.
* Removed CallbackQueue::disable(). Loader removes a nodelet's queues from the queue manager when unloading it, which is sufficient to prevent new callbacks for that nodelet getting added.
* Removed some code and comments concerned with callbacks getting called after their nodelet's destruction. This can't actually happen anymore, since callbacks only fire if they can lock a weak_ptr to their parent nodelet.
* Refactoring to streamline Nodelet back down to a simple plugin interface. It no longer knows about detail::CallbackQueue[Manager] or Bond; init() simply takes the single- and multi-threaded ros::CallbackQueueInterface* instead (defaulting to NULL). Loader owns the callback queues and bond for each nodelet. This makes it possible to use Nodelet without all the surrounding infrastructure.
* Take Bond pointers as const-ref instead of value in Loader and Nodelet.
* Added Loader constructor taking a boost::function object used as a factory for
  nodelet instances, replacing the default use of a pluginlib class loader. This
  is to support ROSGUI, which defines its specialized plugin interface as a
  subclass of Nodelet, and thus needs a different class loader.
* Removed some debug code in Loader constructor.
* 'nodelet load' more reliably unloads the nodelet on exiting. In particular it intercepts XML-RPC shutdown command, used for example by 'rosnode kill'.
* Enabled error output when service calls fail abnormally.
* Rewrote tracked_object logic to be clearer.
* Have detail::CallbackQueue use a ros::VoidConstWPtr as the tracked object, which is now optional. More generic, and fixes test_nodelet which was broken by the last commit.
* Fixed race conditions/deadlocks when unloading a nodelet. Now disable the nodelet's callback queues before deleting it. The queues have a WPtr to the nodelet, so any outstanding callbacks will get discarded.
* ~Loader now stops callback manager threads before destroying the nodelets. Otherwise the worker threads could operate on nodelet data as/after it's destroyed.
* Use ros::names::parentNamespace().
* Cleaned scoped_ptr's out of ThreadInfo and updated its padding.
* Made ThreadInfo::calling an atomic_count. This allows the manager thread to pick the queue with least work more accurately, and reduces contention b/c getSmallestQueue no longer needs to lock on ``queue_mutex_``.
* Minor code cleanup and finer locking in managerThread().
* Actually pad ThreadInfo to a multiple of 64 bytes. Previous expression was wrongly wrapped in sizeof().
* Instead of ``thread_info_``.resize(num_threads), push each ThreadInfo on individually. With resize(), all threads ended up sharing the same queue_mutex and queue_cond. Doesn't seem to be much of a performance win though.
* Added test instrumentation to CallbackQueueManager to track size of worker thread queues over time. Must be enabled at compilation time with -DNODELET_QUEUE_DEBUG.
* nodelet patches for osx lion support from wjwwood
* Added --no-bond option to nodelet loading to disable bonds.
* updated platform tags
* don't need to link against tinyxml directly
* link against system tinyxml
* Fix for `#4855 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4855>`_
  This fix actually makes sense, but that it wasn't caught earlier
  doesn't.  The construction of
  nodelet::Loader n(false)
  was creating the first node handle and letting it go out of scope,
  which was automagically calling ros::shutdown(), which is a dumb thing
  for ros::NodeHandle to do automagically on destruction.
* Each nodelet now places its bonds on a custom callback queue
* a script to list declared nodelets
* real fix for `#4460 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4460>`_
* patch for `#4460 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4460>`_
* adding support for once, throttle, and filter features.  With unit tests for all but the filters `#4681 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4681>`_
* fix for `#4609 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4609>`_
* MUX simplified by using a 8-connected null filters
  DeMUX has a specialization for message type (uses ros::Subscriber internally by default)
  Added rosdep for nodelet (uuid)

* nodelet uses bond to handle crashes on the manager or the spawner end.  `#4221 <https://github.com/ros/nodelet_core/issues/4221>`_
